# CTF Challenge 01 - Cross-site scripting (XSS)

This is a simple Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge that requires participants to find a vulnerability in the application and trigger an alert to solve the challenge. The project demonstrates a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the application.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file handling client-side logic.

## Features

- A form where participants can enter a username.
- Output area to display results.
- User-friendly and responsive UI.

## Goal of the Challenge

Participants must identify the vulnerability in the application and trigger an alert to complete the challenge. This usually involves analyzing the input handling and JavaScript execution to exploit the XSS vulnerability.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the application in a browser.
2. Enter a username in the input box and submit the form.
3. Analyze the behavior and find the vulnerability.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Practice analyzing and exploiting client-side vulnerabilities.
- Learn how to secure input fields to prevent XSS attacks.

## Submit Your Walkthrough
